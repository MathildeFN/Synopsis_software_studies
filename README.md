**Generative art**

**My entry**

My entry is generative art, focusing on the use of randomness and unpredictable processes.

**The problem to be addressed and why it is important**

I would like to address the problem of authorship, uniqueness and authenticity when using randomness and unpredictable processes in the creation of digital generative art.
I would like to address how digital generative art differs from the traditional types of arts and what effect randomness and unpredictable processes brings to the digital artworks and how it effects the authorship. I think it is important to illuminate the invisible processes behind digital art, to enlighten all its consisting aspects which contain a lot of complicated facets when comparing it to our understanding of traditional art and paintings.

**In my writing I would like to address following questions:**

I will initiate my paper with a presentation of what generative art is, including a definition of generative art and a delamination to my entry. I will look further into the role of elements and rules in the creation of digital art and examine their contributions and effects. In addition I will take a closer look into the syntaxes loop and random, to examine their effects in the digital art and especially the ways randomness contributes to the creation of digital art. Additionally, I will examine how digital art differs from traditional art, including an examination of the way of expressing emotion – discussing the question about whether there is emotion in the creation of digital art or if it only evokes emotions when presenting the final piece? In addition, I will examine the use of language and the workflow in the creation of digital art in a discussion about how it distinguishes from traditional art. Finally, I will end the paper with a discussion about which part in the digital generative artwork you should consider as the actual piece of art, who the authorship belongs to and what impact randomness and unpredictable processes have in relation to the uniqueness and authenticity of the digital artworks.


**To answer my questions, I have planned to use following sources:**

To answer my question about what generative art is, to come up with a definition and to examine the role of rules and elements in digital art, I will use the texts Executing liveness (the chapter about Generativity), Generative Art theory, and Emergence and Generative Art, Generative art and rule-based art, and What is generative art. In addition to look further into the common used syntaxes in digital generative art; loop and random I will use Software studies – a lexicon (the chapter about Loops) and 10 PRINT CHRS(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10 (the chapter about Randomness). 
To examine how digital generative art differs from traditional painting I will use the lecture by Frieder Nake, Keynote presentation, Watermans Art That Makes Itself Symposium 2015, to illuminate the different ways of expressing emotions in the various ways of creating art. To examine use of artificial languages in digital generative art I will use Software studies – a lexicon (the chapter about Language) and Executing liveness (the section about Software art) to examine the invisibility and performativity.
To enable a final discussion about authorship, uniqueness and authenticity I will use the knowledge from the previous examination in this paper in relation to the texts Generative Art Theory (the chapter about Problems in generative art theory) and the text Executing liveness.

**My next steps**

The next steps in the process of writing my final paper are to read and reread the texts and look for quotes with different perspectives on my entry and quotes supporting my thesis. In addition, I am also going to watch the lecture by Frieder Nake and the one by Marius Watz again, and maybe look for more videos about generative art and the use of randomness and unpredictable processes. If possible, I would also like to find more literature about digital generative art that can contribute to my paper.
